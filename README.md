# autoencoder

Here I generate a toy dataset which exhibits a gaussian trend that basically reflect the characteristics of solar radiation in a sunny day with clear sky condition. The power generation in the PV system will be proportional to the radiation fall on the PV panel. As a result of it PV system power generation will follow the gaussian trend. But due to the presence of some fault the experimental power will not follow the same trend (presented by the measured power).
